This project was completed while studying the "Complete C# Masterclass" by Denis Panjuta https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-csharp-masterclass/

Initial design specifications include:
-Make a tictactoe game using only the console for two players
-All win conditions result in declaring who the winner is to the users
-All invalid inputs are declared to the users
-Game will automatically reset after a game is finished

Extra features include:
-Draw condition is declared to users

Future features should include:
-Options for three and four players, with larger boards for each set up
-Highscore text file to track users that have won the most amount of games
-Optimizations to follow "clean code" practices
